<a href = "0.1-HeadAndBody.html">Visit our website</a>

<p>href stands for hyperlink reference and the link can be opened in a new tab by passing a new
    parameter called target and assigning it as "_blank" in the anchor tag
</p>

<a href = "0.2-BlockAndInline.html" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer" hreflang="en-US">click on this</a>
<p> rel="noopener" stops a new tab from manipulating the opening tab for security. <br>
    rel="noreferrer" also prevents this, plus it stops the new tab from seeing which page you came from for privacy.</P>


you can add references to other tags in the same page
