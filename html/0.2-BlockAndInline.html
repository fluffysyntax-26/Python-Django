<!-- block elements occupy the entire width available to them and they always start on a newline -->
<div>Hello</div>
<div>World</div>

<p>The paragraph tag is also a type of block element</p>

<!-- h1 is a block element while em (emphasies the word) is an inline element -->
<h1>
    I have an <em>emphazied</em> word!
</h1> 

<p> 
    should you use <b>BOLD</b>, <strong>strong</strong> or <em>emphasized</em>
</p>


<ul>
    <li><strong>strong</strong> is for important content</li>
    <li><em>emphasized</em> is for content that, when spoken, would be said in a different, more emphatic, tone.
    <li><b>Bold</b> is for making text bold without meaning it is more important- it is seldom used, as we can make text bold using CSS
</ul>

<p>Another key  difference between block and inline elements is that block elements
    take up 100% of the available width, while inline elements only take up the width of their content<br> 
    block level elements stack vertically, even if there's horizontal space available<br> 
    CSS can be used to change the display property elements, including making block level elements
    behave like inline elements
