<!-- GET Requests are used to retreive data from the server, you can also include data in the URL to send data to the server
but, the data stored in the URL is not safe, especially if it includes something sensitive. So,
POST Requests are used to send data to the server, 
you can hide data in the body of the POST request which is also called as the Payload -->

<form> 
    <p>

        <!-- input is an inline element and it is self closing -->
        <!-- the name attribute in the input tag, is where the key of teh Name label is associated with, the actual value in
        the name field will be filled instead of 'name' in the name attribute and that can be used in POST requests -->
