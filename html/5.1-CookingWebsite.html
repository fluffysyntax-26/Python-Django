    <p>Garlic Butter Pasta is a simple, comforting dish made with just a few ingredients—pasta, butter, and sautéed garlic. It's rich, flavorful, and perfect for a quick meal. Optional toppings like Parmesan or chili flakes add an extra kick!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients Needed: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g (about 7 oz) spaghetti or any pasta you like</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>3–4 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>Black pepper (to taste)</li>
        <li>Optional: chili flakes, grated Parmesan, parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta: Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve about ½ cup of pasta water, then drain.</li>
        <li>Make the garlic butter sauce: In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add chopped garlic and sauté for about 1-2 minutes, until fragrant and just golden (don’t burn it!).</li>
        <li>Combine Pasta and Sauce: Add the drained pasta to the skillet. Toss to coat with the garlic butter. If it seems dry, add a splash of reserved pasta water until it’s glossy.</li>
        <li>Season and serve: Season with salt, pepper, and optional chili flakes. Serve hot, topped with Parmesan and chopped parsley if you like.</li>
    </ol>
