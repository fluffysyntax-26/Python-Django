<h1>Divs and Spans</h1>

<p>Divs are used to group multiple elements together</p>
<div>
    You can put text here! but no.
    <p>Text makes more sense when they are inside a paragraph</p>

    <style>
        /* class is like a id, but a same class can be used multiple times unlike and id which is unique */
        .emphasis{
            font-style : italic;
        }
    </style>
    <p>You can use span <span class = "emphasis">Emphasize</span> text with a span<br>
        but you have to define the class for the span to take place
        <br><br>
        it is not adviced to use a class to emphasize something, the em tag should suffice, but
        if it is purely for styling, classes can be used
</div>
